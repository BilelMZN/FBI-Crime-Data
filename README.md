# FBI-Crime-Data

This repository contains a school project about F.B.I. Crime Data. We first cleaned the data in order to have tidy data. Then, we focused on the visualization and tried to analyze what we saw. The data came from the official website of F.B.I : <html> https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s  

There are our RMarkdown file and our report.
